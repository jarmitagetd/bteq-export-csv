Program written to enable quick generation of bteq scritps to provide sample data sets to end users in csv format.  
BTEQ provides a header record so was chosen over TPT.  Installation notes and how to run (Linux only):

-- install: just copy the github repository folder into your user folder on Linux (eg /home/james/)
-- check the BTEQ path is correct in the file expbteq.sh.  You can check your BTEQ path by running the command "which bteq"
-- you can change the SQL statement if required in the file sql/bteqexp.sql
-- TO RUN ./expbteq.sh or bash expbteq.sh
